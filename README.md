# miniRT

In this 42 project you have to create a "mini" ray tracer in a group of 2. I did the project together with Daniel Noom.

The aim of this project is to implement "simple" math into code. The mandatory part is not too exciting but in the bonus you can go above and beyond.
For example, we implemented mirrors, mirrors that have a bump/normal map, "dirty" mirrors that base their reflection on a texture, paraboloid objects and more. 
We also made the project quicker by using multithreading. 

Below are some examples of scenes rendered using our raytracer.
